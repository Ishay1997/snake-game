# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! This is a classic arcade game where you control a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake itself.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: The objective of the game is to control the snake to eat as much food as possible without colliding with walls or itself.

2. **Controls**: 
   - Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.
   - Alternatively, you can use the WASD keys (W for up, A for left, S for down, D for right).

3. **Gameplay**:
   - The snake starts with a length of 1 and will move in the direction you specify.
   - Once the snake eats a piece of food, it will grow longer by one segment.
   - The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

4. **Scoring**:
   - Each piece of food eaten increases your score.
   - The longer the snake becomes, the higher your score will be.
